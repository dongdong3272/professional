#### 1. VisualNeo: Bridging the Gap between Visual Query Interfaces and Graph Query Engines (VLDBâ€™23)

###### _(Author: K. Huang, H. Liang, C. Yao, X. Zhao, Y. Cui, Y. Tian, R. Zhang, X. Zhou.)_

**Abstract**: Visual Graph Query Interfaces (VQIs) empower non-programmers to query graph data by constructing visual queries intuitively. De- vising efficient technologies in Graph Query Engines (GQEs) for interactive search and exploration has also been studied for years. However, these two vibrant scientific fields are traditionally independent of each other, causing a vast barrier for users who wish to explore the full-stack operations of graph querying. In this demonstration, we propose a novel VQI system built upon Neo4j called VisualNeo that facilities an efficient subgraph query in large graph databases. VisualNeo inherits several advanced features from re- cent advanced VQIs, which include the data-driven GUI design and canned pattern generation. Additionally, it embodies a database manager module in order that users can connect to generic Neo4j databases. It performs query processing through the Neo4j driver and provides an aesthetic query result exploration.
